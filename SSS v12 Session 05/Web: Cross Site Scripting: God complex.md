# Web: Cross Site Scripting: God complex


Find the flag at ctf-05.

So we have the classic input **</script>alert(1)</script>** and then we get the phrase: You are on the good road, keep trying! Hint: make the right order! Btw: every time this happens the database gets deleted! :)

So, this means probably we have the wrong input.
