We enter on the subscription page, then we fill in the credintials.
We observe after that after the creditential completion is good, the page redirect us to a invoice page.
If we change the invoice page index we then observe we get more invoicees but some of them are "Oops, no invoice".

So then we have to test all the invoices to check in which page we get the "SSS", which is at the page 10946.
